Key is a attribute which helps you identify a row in a table.

It uniquely identifies a row in table.

It creates constraints that can be used to enforce data integrity.

Helps to establish relationship between the user and the table.

Types of key : 
1. Primary key : This column accepts unique values to identify a row.
                 Only one primary key exists in a table.
                 It cannot be null.

2. Candidate key : Defined as a set of one or more columns that can identify a row or tuple uniquely.
                   Can have multiple candidate keys.
                   It can contain null values.

3. Alternate key : This are subsets of candidate keys which can also identify table which are not chosen as primary key.

4. Super key : It is a combination of all possible attributes which can uniquely identify a row.
               Super key is a superset of primary, candidate, alternate keys.
               with less number of attributes it is a candidate key.

5. Foreigh key : It is the set of attributes which refers to primary key of the another table.
                 The table with foreign key is child table and one with primary key is parent table.
                 Can have multiple foreign keys and contain null values.

6. Unique key : 

7. Composite key :
