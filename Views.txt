Instead of writing the same long query all the time we make a view out of it.
Syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
sql_query

View is actually a virtual table not a real table. Update, Delete and Insert can be performed unless your query do not contain
1. Aggregate functions
2. Distinct
3. Joins
4. Group By
5. Having
7. Union
8. Subquery (If it is not non-dependant Update and Delete can be performed)

If you want to alter the table then the syntax is:
1. CREATE OR REPLACE  VIEW view_name AS
   sql_query
2. ALTER VIEW view_name AS
   sql_query
